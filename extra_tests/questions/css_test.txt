# What is the purpose of the z-index and how is it used?
The z-index helps to specify the stack order of positioned elements that may overlap one another. The z-index default value is zero and can take on either a positive or negative number.
An element with a higher z-index is always stacked above than a lower index.
Z-Index can take the following values:
    Auto: Sets the stack order equal to its parents.
    Number: Orders the stack order.
    Initial: Sets this property to its default value (0).
    Inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.

# Name some CSS style components.
Some CSS Style components are:
    Selector
    Property
    Value

# What is universal selector?
Rather than selecting elements of a specific type, the universal selector quite simply matches the name of any element type −
* { 
   color: #000000; 
}

# What is Descendant Selector?
Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a particular element. As given in the following example, style rule will apply to <em> element only when it lies inside <ul> tag.
ul em {
   color: #000000; 
}

# What is class selector?
You can define style rules based on the class attribute of the elements. All the elements having that class will be formatted according to the defined rule.
.black {
   color: #000000; 
}
This rule renders the content in black for every element with class attribute set to black in our document.

# Can you make a class selector particular to an element type?
You can make it a bit more particular. For example −
h1.black {
   color: #000000; 
}
This rule renders the content in black for only <h1> elements with class attribute set to black.


# What is a child selector?
Consider the following example −
body > p {
   color: #000000;
}
This rule will render all the paragraphs in black if they are direct child of <body> element. Other paragraphs put inside other elements like <div> or <td> would not have any effect of this rule.
