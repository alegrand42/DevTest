Given a sequence of integers, where each element is distinct and satisfies . For each where , find any integer such that and print the value of

on a new line.

For example, assume the sequence
. Each value of between and

, the length of the sequence, is analyzed as follows:

, so , so , so , so , so The values for are

.
