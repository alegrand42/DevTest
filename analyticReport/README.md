# ANALYTICS REPORT

## Exercise

The goal of the exercise is to write a program that generates a report given a CSV file.

The CSV file has the following columns: website, impressions, revenue
impressions: number of times an ad has been displayed on the website
revenue: total revenue generated by the impressions on the website

The user of the program wants to see:
- the website with the highest impressions
- the website with the highest revenue
- the website with the highest cpm (1)
- the cpm (1) for each website, rounded to 2 decimals, sorted by cpm in descendant order
(1) cpm is the cost per thousand impressions (technically, “cost per mille”).
(1) cpm = (revenue / impressions) * 1000

The class of the program must output the report formatted in plain text, followed by the report in HTML

## Expected output

```bash
bash $> gem install csv
bash $> ruby solution.rb
##############
# PLAIN TEXT #
##############
*** Winners ***
The website with the highest revenue is: ubuntu.com
The website with the highest impressions is: apple.com
The website with the highest cpm is: google.com
*** cpm ***
- google.com: 0.56
- ubuntu.com: 0.18
- microsoft.com: 0.1
- apple.com: 0.09
